      <p>
        <b>“Personal Information”</b> is information that, either alone or in combination with
        other information, identifies you. Examples of Personal Information include, among others,
        name, email address, phone number, and mailing address. When we combine Personal
        Information with other information (such as the name of the company you work for), we
        treat the combined information as Personal Information.

      <div className="pl-50">
        <Header as="h5">A. Information that You Provide to Us</Header>
        <p>
          In various places on the Service, we request information, including Personal
          Information, from you via forms.  The exact information we need to collect will
          depend on the purpose of the form.  For example, when you create an account as an
          investor, we ask you to provide your email address, first and last name, mailing
          address, phone number, date of birth, and financial details necessary for you to
          make investments (e.g., bank account information). However, as another example, we
          only request your name, email address, and business name when you join our
          Entrepreneurs Mailing List.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will indicate on the form whether a particular field of information is mandatory
          or optional. You may choose not to provide certain information, but we may not be
          able to provide requested services.
        </p>
        <Header as="h5">B. Information We Receive through Your Use of the Service</Header>
        <p>
          We collect the following types of information automatically through your use of the
          Service:
        </p>
        <Header as="h5" className="grey-header">Support Information</Header>
        <p>
          When you use the Platform, we will record information relating to transactions
          (e.g., making an investment, receiving a payment) conducted through the Platform.
          With your permission, we may obtain certain information relating to purchases you
          make in order to reward you for supporting participating businesses.
        </p>
        <Header as="h5" className="grey-header">Cookies, Device Identifiers, and Similar technologies</Header>
        <p>
          When you use or access the Service, we, our service providers, and our
          advertisers use cookies, device identifiers, and similar technologies such as
          pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use
          the Service.  We process the information collected through such technologies,
          which may include Personal Information, to help operate certain features of the
          Service, to enhance your experience through personalization, and to help us
          better understand the features of the Service that you and other users are most
          interested in.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, we use analytics tools to capture information about your use of
          the Service, such as pages you visit, mouse clicks and scrolling activity. The
          providers of these tools may use cookies and other techniques to capture data
          about your activity on our site.  As another example, if you arrive at our
          Service by clicking on an advertisement or content published by a third party,
          that third party may provide information to us about your activity on their site.
        </p>
        <p>
          We permit certain third parties to display content on our Service. If you view
          pages containing this content (even if you do not directly interact with it),
          these content providers may collect information about your use of the Service.
          These providers may combine information collected about you on our Service with
          any Personal Information about you that they may have to enable them to track
          you across multiple sites and over time.   You should review the third party’s
          privacy policy for more information about the data they collect and their use
          and disclosure of the data.  (For more information on third-party providers used
          in connection with this Service, including links to their privacy policies,
          please see Appendix: NextSeed Service Providers at the end of this Privacy Policy).
        </p>
        <p>
          Most browsers provide you with the ability to block, delete, or disable cookies,
          and your mobile device may allow you to disable transmission of unique identifiers
          and location data. If you choose to reject cookies or block device identifiers, some
          features of the Site may not be available or some functionality may be limited or
          unavailable.  Please review the help pages of your browser or mobile device for
          assistance with changing your settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the information we gather on the Site and Platform, we may use
          web beacons within e-mails that we send to track whether you actually view our
          messages or content.<br />
          At this time, the Service does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals sent
          by your browser, but some of our third-party providers may honor these signals
          in accordance with their privacy policies.
        </p>
        <Header as="h5" className="grey-header">Third-Party Authentication Information</Header>
        <p>
          Instead of creating a separate log-in on our Platform, we may enable you to log into
          the Platform using a social media account.  If NextSeed acquires information about you
          from such third parties, it may tie this third party provided information to the
          information it collects from or about you as part of your visit to the Site or use of
          the Platform. Please refer to the privacy settings of the applicable social media
          platform to determine how you may manage the interactivity between the Platform and
          your social media account.
        </p>
        <Header as="h5" className="grey-header">Location Data</Header>
        <p>
          If you grant us access (via browser or device settings), we may collect information
          concerning the location of your device.  We use this information to help personalize
          the Service by providing you more relevant information and to help expedite the
          insertion of your address when signing up for an account.  You may deny us access to
          this information, but doing so may make certain features unavailable.
        </p>
        <Header as="h5" className="grey-header">Log File Information</Header>
        <p>
          When you use our Service, our servers automatically record information, including
          your Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), browser type, referring URLs (e.g.,
          the site you visited before coming to our Site), number of clicks, and how you
          interact with links on the Site, domain names associated with your internet service
          provider, pages viewed, and other such information (collectively, “Log File
          Information”). We may also collect similar information from emails sent to you which
          then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.
          We use Log File Information collected from our implementation of the Site to further
          our legitimate interests in securing the Site by identifying potential threats and
          vulnerabilities, and in analyzing the effectiveness of our Site to improve the Site’s
          function and content.
        </p>
        <Header as="h5">C. Information We Receive About You from Our Other Users</Header>
        <p>
          We may receive Personal Information about you from users of our Service.
          For example, our business referral page allows users to introduce our business
          development team to entrepreneurs looking to expand. If one our users refers you and
          your business, the user will submit to us your name and business contact information.
          We also may permit users to share with NextSeed contacts via their local address book
          or via a third party service such as Facebook, which may include your contact
          information.<br />
          Regardless of the source, we will process any Personal Information we collect or
          receive in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
