      </p>
      <Header as="h5">ISSUER CONTENT</Header>
      <p>
        Each User that is offering securities on the Website (an <b>“Issuer”</b>) is solely
        responsible for the material such Issuer posts on the Website and, by posting such
        material, represents that (a) it has complied in all material respects with all applicable
        rules and regulations, and (b) such information will not contain any untrue statement of
        a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated or necessary to
        make such statements not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they are
        made.
      </p>
      <p>
        NextSeed has not taken any steps to verify the adequacy, accuracy, or completeness of
        any Issuer materials. Neither NextSeed nor any of its officers, directors, agents, or
        employees makes any warranty, express or implied, of any kind whatsoever related to
        the adequacy, accuracy, or completeness of any Issuer materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Website and the other Users are entitled to rely upon any representations made by
        the Issuer. Each Issuer is solely responsible for ensuring that its securities offering,
        including use of the Website, is in compliance with all applicable statute, law,
        ordinance, regulation, rule, code, injunction, judgment, decree or order of any United
        States or foreign, federal, state, local, municipal or other governmental, regulatory or
        administrative authority, agency or commission or any judicial or arbitral body, or any
        governing body duly authorized to exercise any administrative, judicial, executive,
        legislative, police, regulatory or taxing authority power or authority of any of the
        foregoing (<b>“Applicable Law”</b>). Each authorized representative of an Issuer
        accessing the Website hereby represents and warrants, on behalf of such Issuer,
        that its use of the Website is, and shall be at all times, in compliance with
        Applicable Law.
      </p>
      <Header as="h5">ADDITIONAL SECURITIES MATTERS </Header>
      <p>
        The securities offered on the Website have not been registered under the Securities Act
        of 1933 (the <b>“Securities Act”</b>), and are offered in reliance on the registration
        exemptions provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Rule 506 of Regulation D
        promulgated thereunder, Regulation A, or Regulation CF. Securities sold through private
        placements are restricted and not publicly traded, and are therefore illiquid. Neither
        the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission or other
        regulatory authority has approved, passed upon, or endorsed the merits of any offering on
        the Website.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may not become a beneficial owner of 20% or more of any issuer’s outstanding voting
        equity securities (an <b>“Issuer Covered Person”</b>) without becoming subject to certain
        “bad actor” disqualifying events described in Rule 506(d) (a <b>“Disqualifying Event”</b>).
        You represent that you are not subject to a Disqualifying Event and that you will promptly
        notify NextSeed in writing should any Disqualifying Events be applicable to you.
        NextSeed is not liable or responsible for making Rule 506(e) disclosures, nor for
        determining whether any Issuer Covered Person is subject to a Disqualifying Event.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, nothing in these Terms shall be
        deemed to be a waiver, and we will not assert there has been a waiver, that would not be
        permissible under Section 14 of the Securities Act, Section 29(a) of the Securities
        Exchange Act of 1934, or any other applicable provision of federal and state securities
        laws.

      <Header as="h5">CONSENT TO ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AND DISCLOSURES</Header>
      <p>
        By acceptance of these Terms, you consent and agree to transact business with us online
        and electronically and to receive electronically, either via the Website or at the email
        address that you have registered on the Website, all documents, communications, notices,
        periodic reports (not less frequently than quarterly), contracts, and agreements arising
        from or relating in any way to your or our rights, obligations or services under this
        Agreement (each, a <b>“Disclosure”</b>).  The foregoing consent to transact business
        online and electronically applies to any transactions to which Disclosures relate.
      </p>
      <p>
        All notices, requests, demands, required Disclosures, and other communications from
        NextSeed to you will either be transmitted to you by email to the email address you have
        registered on the Website or will be posted on the Website, and shall be deemed to have
        been duly given and effective upon such transmission or posting, as applicable. If your
        registered email address, residence address or telephone number changes, you must
        promptly update such information on the Website. You shall send all notices or other
        communications required or permitted to be given hereunder to NextSeed via email to
        support@nextseed.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        You further consent and agree to receive electronically all future tax informational
        returns and forms from the Issuers (the <b>“Tax Statements”</b>) unless you notify us that
        you do not consent to electronic delivery or if you withdraw your consent at a later
        time. NextSeed will not provide Tax Statements (either directly or indirectly) to you
        electronically if you (a) provide a notice that you do not consent to electronic
        delivery, (b) provide a notice to withdraw consent to electronic delivery, (c) cease
        to be a User, or (d) if regulations change to prohibit the form of delivery. If you do
        not consent to, or if you would like to withdraw your consent to, electronic delivery of
        Tax Statements from NextSeed, you may submit a request by emailing support@nextseed.com
        or calling us at 800-705-4220. In the event that you do not consent to or if you withdraw
        your consent to electronic delivery of Tax Statements, we will mail you paper copies of
        the applicable Tax Statements at the address associated with your Account. A tax document
        provides important information you need to complete your tax returns. Much of the
        information we provide in tax documents is also reported to the IRS.  This includes any
        corrected documents and accompanying notices. When your tax documents are ready, we will
        send an email notification containing a web link to the document available after you log
        in.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree to keep a working email address and other current contact information and will
        update your account information immediately if your email address or other contact
        information changes. If you do not maintain an email address that is working and accessible
        to us, or if for any other reason we believe that providing notice via your email address is
        not sufficient to provide for delivery of required documents, and we believe we are required
        to provide your paper notice or documents of particular matters or actions, and we do so,
        we may charge you an additional fee of not more than $100 per each such delivery. You
        acknowledge that you also may be charged other fees associated with providing our online
        service when additional, different, or non-standard efforts are required with respect to
        your Account, such as the generation of notices to you stating that your email address is
        “bouncing”. If your email address or other contact information changes at any time, you
        must update your Account information accordingly. If we send you a paper reminder of the need
        to have an email address that is working and accessible to us, we will charge a reasonable fee
        for each reminder.
      </p>

      <Header as="h5">GENERAL</Header>
      <p>
        <i>Governing Law</i><br />
        These Terms are governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of Delaware
        without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would require the application
        of the law of a different jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Dispute Resolution</i><br />
        In the event of any claim, controversy, or alleged dispute between you and NextSeed or
        its affiliates (<b>“Dispute”</b>), you hereby agree to attempt in good faith to amicably
        resolve any Dispute at least 30 days before instituting any legal proceeding. Each party
        agrees to submit any Dispute for resolution by final binding arbitration after serving
        written notice, which notice shall set forth in detail the controversy, question, claim,
        or alleged breach along with your attempt to resolve such Dispute. Upon such notice and
        attempt to resolve, the party may then commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to the
        rules of the American Arbitration Association (<b>“AAA”</b>) to be held in Houston, Texas,
        before an arbitrator to be selected by the AAA. Any such arbitration may only be commenced
        within one year after the party requesting arbitration obtains knowledge of the cause of
        action forming the basis of the controversy or claim accrued.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any arbitration and subject to the ultimate discretion of the presiding arbitrator,
        each side will be limited to a maximum of one day of argument (including rebuttal), and
        the parties agree in good faith to minimize discovery burdens. The decision(s) of the
        arbitrator shall be final and binding and may not be appealed to any court of competent
        jurisdiction, or otherwise, except upon claim of fraud or corruption as by law provided;
        provided, however, that implementation of such decision(s) shall in no way be delayed or
        otherwise impaired pending the outcome of any such appeal. Judgment upon the award rendered
        in such arbitration may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. You agree that
        all Disputes will be limited between you, individually, and NextSeed. To the full extent
        allowable by law, you agree that no arbitration proceeding or other dispute resolution
        proceeding shall be joined with any other party or decided on a class-action basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that the following matters shall not, at the
        election of NextSeed, be subject to binding arbitration: (a) any Dispute related to, or
        arising from allegations of criminal activity; (b) any Dispute concerning NextSeed{"'"}s
        intellectual property rights; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any Dispute not subject to arbitration shall be decided by a court of competent
        jurisdiction within Harris County, Texas. Each party hereby waives any claim that such
        venue is improper or inconvenient. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF
        ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT
        MATTER HEREOF. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL
        DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THESE
        TERMS, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF DUTY
        CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. EACH PARTY HEREBY FURTHER REPRESENTS
        AND WARRANTS THAT SUCH PARTY HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT SUCH
        PARTY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH
        LEGAL COUNSEL.
      </p>
      <p>

        <i>Severability</i><br />
        If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision
        will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will
        otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. If for any reason a court or
        arbitral, as applicable, of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms
        invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
        permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Force Majeure</i><br />
        NextSeed shall not be liable for any failure to provide the Website where such failure

        by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically

      </p>
      <p>
        <i>No Waiver</i><br />
        NextSeed’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a
        waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or
        provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized
        representative of NextSeed.
