          The following risk factors are intended to highlight certain risks associated
          with investing in securities offered on www.nextseed.com (“NextSeed”) by Issuers
          facilitated by NextSeed Securities LLC and NextSeed US LLC and are not exhaustive.
          You should also review any disclosure documents and risk factors provided by the
          business issuing the securities (“Issuer”). These risk factors are not intended
          to provide professional legal, tax or financial advice. Please consult your
          financial advisor before investing. Securities offered on NextSeed are highly
          speculative, so you should not invest if you cannot afford to lose your entire
          investment.

        <Header as="h5">Issuers and securities offered are not registered with the SEC</Header>
        <p>
          Securities offered by Issuers on NextSeed are not registered with the Securities
          and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in reliance, among other exemptions, on the
          exemptions provided by Section 4(a)(2), Section 4(a)(6) and/or Regulation D of the
          Securities Act of 1933. Issuers also rely on available exemptions from securities
          registration or qualification requirements under applicable state securities laws.
          No assurance can be given that Issuers or offerings currently qualify or will
          continue to qualify for the exemption or exemptions relied upon, due to any
          changes in securities laws or regulations that apply retroactively, the adequacy
          of disclosures, and the manner of distribution, among other qualifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it is found that an Issuer is non-exempt and failed to register its offering,
          or found to have conducted any acts or omissions constituting offenses under the
          Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or applicable state
          securities laws, the Issuer could suffer adverse consequences that negatively
          affect its operations. Additionally, if any claims or lawsuits are brought
          against Issuer for any such failure to register, the Issuer could be adversely
          affected by the costs and time needed for any legal defense.

        <p>
          Securities offered on NextSeed’s platform will not be recommended or approved by
          any federal or state securities commission or regulatory authority. These
          authorities will not pass upon the merits of any securities offered or the terms
          of the offering on NextSeed’s platform. Furthermore, these authorities will not
          take a view upon the accuracy or adequacy of this document or any offering
          documents.

        <Header as="h5">Issuers may not have the financial controls, reporting and disclosure procedures of public companies</Header>
        <p>
          Issuers are not public companies and not subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
          Therefore, it may not have financial controls, reporting or disclosure procedures that
          would meet the standards of a public company subject to Sarbanes-Oxley requirements.
          An Issuer’s financial controls and disclosure procedures reflect its non-public company
          status and there can be no guarantee that there are no significant weaknesses or
          deficiencies in its controls and procedures. If an Issuer needed to implement such
          controls and procedures, the cost of compliance could be substantial and could have
          a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s operations.

        <Header as="h5">Issuers rely on representations made by investors</Header>
        <p>
          Issuers rely on exemptions to securities registration when offering securities on
          NextSeed. Such exemptions depend on representations of the investors made to the
          Issuer in connection with the offering. If any such representation proves to be
          false, such exemptions may not be available to the Issuer and the Issuer may be
          adversely affected and liable under applicable securities laws.

          Issuers may not be required to provide financial statements or balance sheets that
          have been audited by an independent CPA. Any financial statements or balance sheets
          provided may contain limited information, such as a limited time period, and may not
          be an accurate or complete representation of the current financial condition of the
          Issuer. Additionally, Issuers may not be required to provide annual or quarterly
          audited financial reports or audited balance sheets.

        <p>
          The execution and success of a business depend on the business owners.
          Entrepreneurship is inherently risky, and there is a chance that the business
          you invest in will not survive the entire term of your investment to pay you back
          in full  or a chance that it will not open at all.  Each venture is unique with
          its own set of variable factors, and even the most seasoned entrepreneurs may
          not succeed in their next venture.

        <Header as="h5">The projections provided by an Issuer are not guaranteed</Header>
        <p>
          Issuers seek to provide prospective investors with information on how they think
          the business will perform on good faith and relying on reasonable assumptions.
          Investors should bear in mind that past, targeted or projected performance
          doesn’t necessarily mean that those results will be achieved in the future.
          There are no assurances that the business will have comparable results.

        <Header as="h5">Businesses may require additional capital, which may not be available</Header>
        <p>
          Issuers may require additional capital for its operations, to develop new products
          or services, marketing, or other business activities. There is no assurance that
          an Issuer will be able to obtain any additional funding currently or as needed in
          the future. Even if there is available capital, the terms may be unfavorable or may
          be terms that excessively dilute existing equity holders. If additional funding is
          not available to Issuers when needed, Issuers may not be able to make payments to
          investors when due, and its business may be adversely affected.

        <Header as="h5">Past performances of businesses on NextSeed are not reliable predictors of success for other businesses</Header>
        <p>
          The success of past businesses that have raised funds on NextSeed does not
          guarantee the success of any other business raising funds on NextSeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The historic returns and data on past NextSeed businesses are provided for
          informational purposes only to celebrate the successes of local communities.
          This information should not be interpreted as investment advice or as any
          guarantee of investment returns on any other business raising funds on NextSeed.
          Each business and each investment is unique, and you may not see similar, if any,
          returns on your own investments.
        </p>
        <p>
          For term notes, the interest rate is set up front. Some businesses have chosen to
          make prepayments in full or in part without penalty, but this does not mean you
          will see the same results with any other business you invest in.
        </p>
        <p>
          For revenue sharing notes, the rate of return is ultimately dependent on each
          business’ success, such as how quickly the business opens and the amount of
          revenues earned by the business each month, among other factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          For any equity investments, any potential dividend payments are made as set forth
          in the underlying investment agreement. Any increase in the value of equity stock
          may be realized through a sale of that stock, however, your ability to sell equity
          stock is limited because there is no secondary market where you can freely buy
          and sell your stock.

        <Header as="h5">Past performances of a specific entrepreneur do not guarantee the success of an investment</Header>
        <p>
          The prior success of an entrepreneur does not guarantee the success of any new
          venture by that entrepreneur. Each business venture is unique, and while the
          prior experience of an entrepreneur may be relevant, it is possible that the
          entrepreneur may not be as successful in the new venture.
        </p>
        <p>
          A business’s success depends on various factors that are outlined in its
          disclosure documents for each offering. These may include factors such as brand
          perception, reputation, competition, management, labor supply, personnel, market
          conditions, supply and delivery costs, operational factors, financing, real estate,
          and more. Even with past experience, an entrepreneur may not be able to overcome
          the difficulties that arise in their new venture.

        <Header as="h5">Investments are not guaranteed</Header>
        <p>
          No investments are “guaranteed” or risk-free. While debt offerings may provide a
          security interest (in the form of a lien on the assets of the business itself) or a
          personal guarantee by the owners of the business, neither of these are absolute
          guarantees of any repayment.  It is possible that the security interest may not
          be sufficient to pay you back fully, and it may not be possible to enforce the
          security interests due to other legal considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Preferred equity investments are not guaranteed or secured by any assets of the
          business.

        <Header as="h5">The securities sold in offerings on NextSeed are restricted and not freely transferrable</Header>
        <p>
          Unlike the public stock market, you will not be able to freely sell the securities
          that you purchase on NextSeed. There is no public market or secondary market for
          the securities at this time and none is expected to develop.
        </p>
        <p>
          There may be required holding periods for any securities purchased on NextSeed
          according to applicable laws. If you want to sell your securities at a later time,
          it is possible that you may not be able to identify any buyers, leaving you with
          very little recourse.

        <Header as="h5">There are few potential avenues for financial return</Header>
        <p>
          The source of payment on an investment is from the Issuer, as laid out in the investment agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if commercially reasonable steps are taken on behalf of investors to
          facilitate the collection of outstanding payment from the business, it is
          possible that there is little recourse left for investors. In such event, it
          is possible that there may not be any valuable assets left in the business to
          make the investor whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          Equity investments have no set maturity dates and should be viewed as long-term
          investments. Any increase in the valuation of equity shares may be realized by
          selling those shares, however, there is currently no secondary market for those
          shares and you may not be able to find a buyer.

        <Header as="h5">Bonus rewards are voluntary </Header>
        <p>
          The bonus rewards offered by an Issuer are purely voluntary as a way for the Issuer
          to show appreciation to investors and not governed by the investment agreements.
          The bonus rewards are independent of the terms of the investment—for instance, if
          a business offers more bonus rewards, that does not mean it will offer a lower
          interest rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bonus rewards are not enforceable under the investment agreement that you
          sign, and there is a risk that you will not receive the bonus rewards offered by
          the business or will be unable to use the bonus rewards because of restrictions
          placed by the business. NextSeed cannot force a business to fulfill its bonus
          rewards. The business owners are encouraged to honor the rewards so that they
          foster a good relationship with their investors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, if you invest using an IRA, there may be restrictions on whether you
          can receive the rewards yourself. Consult your tax advisor to find out how an
          IRA may impact bonus rewards.

        <Header as="h5">The projections provided by a business may not be achieved</Header>
        <p>
          The financial forecast a business provides is generally based on their experience
          and market trends. As with all financial forecasts, the results are based on
          assumptions made at the time of its creation and there is no assurance that those
          results will be achieved. Many external factors, like unpredictable economic
          factors, can materially affect those forecasts. Actual results may be
          significantly different from the forecasts.

        <Divider hidden />
        <Header as="h5">The laws and rules governing NextSeed and the securities sold on NextSeed may change</Header>
        <p>
          NextSeed and Issuers rely on existing rules such as Regulation Crowdfunding and
          Regulation D 506(c), among others. The implementation and interpretation of any
          such rules are continuing to evolve.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a possibility that changes to these rules may negatively impact how
          NextSeed operates, including how NextSeed services the securities.

          Businesses that offer debt securities on NextSeed intend in good faith to treat
          the securities as debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

          Businesses that offer equity securities on NextSeed intend in good faith to treat

        <p>
          This is not intended to be legal or tax advice to you as an investor. The IRS may

          purposes.
